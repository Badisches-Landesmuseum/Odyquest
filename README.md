# Odyquest

The project Odyquest is a framework for scavenger hunts and escape games.
The heart is a web app.
It tells a story which leads you for example through a exhibition in a museum discovering the small details
while hunting for a ghost or helping a robot travelling back to the future.

The project consists of three parts:

* a web app as frontend for users,
* a server as api backend for data storage,
* and a CMS for game creation and editing.

* [Installation guide](documentation/installation.md)
* [Documentation for developers](documentation/development.md)
